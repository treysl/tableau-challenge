Providing a ride-sharing program like Citi Bike can greatly benefit a community, as evidenced by the impressive 63,072 bike rides taken in March alone. This represents a significant amount of data to analyze. While most of the Citi Bike locations are concentrated in Hoboken and Jersey City in New York, there is also growing exposure in Bergen, where the median income is $51k-$61k. However, it is worth noting that the bulk of the revenue is derived from the higher income areas near the Hudson River, where the median income is $61k-$81k/year, as per the income data provided by the 2018 census.

As depicted on the map above, Hoboken stands out as the location with the top ten revenue performers among all Citi Bike locations. Each location offers three bike options - Classic (manual pedaling), Electric (automated pedaling), and Docked (locked securely in a designated location to prevent unauthorized use). Among these options, Classic Bikes are the most frequently rented, followed by Electric Bikes. Interestingly, the data reveals that many bikes were active and not docked, which is a positive sign for revenue generation.

Although the data regarding the day of the week has certain limitations, I have tried my best to provide a sliding scale that covers the month-long data, allowing flexibility in exploring trends at both micro and macro levels. Unfortunately, I was not able to delve as deeply as I would have liked to uncover daily or weekly trends.

### Further Analysis to Complete
Given more time and access to a broader range of data, my plan is to conduct a more in-depth exploration of the riders' gender usage, daily and weekly trends, as well as revenue distribution by location.
